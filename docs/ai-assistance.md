# AI Assistance Guide

## Overview

GAIA MATRIX features an integrated AI Assistant that provides code generation, problem-solving, and development guidance directly within the editor. This document explains how to leverage AI assistance to accelerate your game development workflow.

## Accessing the AI Assistant

The AI Assistant can be accessed in several ways:

1. **Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+A` (macOS/Gaia OS) and type your query
2. **Chat Panel**: Click the chat icon in the bottom right corner of the editor
3. **Code Context Menu**: Right-click on code and select "Ask AI Assistant"
4. **AOPL Specific Assistance**: Type `/ai` in any AOPL file to get context-aware help

## Key Features

### Code Generation

The AI Assistant can generate AOPL code based on natural language descriptions:

1. **Entity Creation**: Generate game entities with components
2. **Component Logic**: Create component behaviors
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Set up ML model connections
4. **Procedural Generation**: Design MCP systems

Example prompt:
```
Generate AOPL code for a first-person camera controller with head bobbing effect that uses neural network to adjust smoothing based on player movement speed.
```

### Code Explanation

Get explanations for complex code or AOPL syntax:

1. Select code and right-click
2. Choose "Explain Selected Code"
3. Review the explanation in the AI Assistant panel

### Debugging Assistance

The AI Assistant can help identify and fix issues:

1. Select problematic code
2. Right-click and choose "Debug with AI"
3. Follow the assistant's troubleshooting steps

### Learning Resources

Access contextual learning materials:

1. **Tutorials**: Request step-by-step guides
2. **Documentation Links**: Get references to relevant docs
3. **Examples**: View annotated code examples

## Advanced Features

### AOPL Symbol Reference

The AI Assistant understands all AOPL symbols and can explain their usage:

```
What does the âŠ¿ symbol do in AOPL?
```

### Neural Engine Configuration

Get assistance with Neural Engine setup and optimization:

```
How should I configure my neural network for efficient Neural Engine execution on M2 Pro?
```

### Model Selection

Receive recommendations for suitable AI models:

```
What type of neural network architecture would work best for procedural terrain generation?
```

## Workflow Integration

### Project Analysis

The AI Assistant can analyze your entire project:

1. Choose "Analyze Project" from the AI menu
2. Review suggestions for optimization, architecture improvements, and best practices

### Pattern Recognition

Identify code patterns and suggest improvements:

```
Review my entity component structure and suggest optimizations
```

### Documentation Generation

Auto-generate documentation for your code:

1. Select code section
2. Right-click and choose "Generate Documentation"
3. Review and adjust the generated documentation

## Customization

### Training on Your Codebase

The AI Assistant can learn from your project:

1. Go to Preferences > AI Assistant
2. Enable "Learn from Project"
3. Select which parts of your codebase to include

### Personalization

Adjust the AI Assistant to match your preferences:

1. Go to Preferences > AI Assistant > Personalization
2. Configure code style, verbosity, and suggestion frequency

### Team Knowledge Base

Create a shared knowledge base for team projects:

1. Go to Preferences > AI Assistant > Team Knowledge
2. Add team-specific patterns, conventions, and notes

## Best Practices

### Effective Prompting

For best results with the AI Assistant:

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly describe what you need
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant details about your project
3. **Iterate**: Refine requests based on initial responses
4. **Use References**: Mention existing code when relevant

### When to Use AI Assistance

The AI Assistant is most helpful for:

1. **Exploration**: Learning new GAIA MATRIX features
2. **Repetitive Tasks**: Generating similar code patterns
3. **Integration**: Connecting different systems
4. **Optimization**: Identifying performance improvements
5. **Problem Solving**: Debugging complex issues

### Limitations

Be aware of these limitations:

1. **Knowledge Cutoff**: The AI may not know about the very latest features
2. **Complex Architectures**: May need guidance on large-scale design
3. **Project-Specific Details**: Cannot know private API details unless shared

## Example Workflows

### Game Entity Development

```
1. Ask: "Create an AOPL entity for a weapon pickup with glow effect"
2. Review generated code
3. Ask: "Add neural network-based interaction detection"
4. Integrate with existing systems
```

### Neural Enhancement Pipeline

```
1. Ask: "Set up an image enhancement neural network for post-processing"
2. Ask: "How should I optimize this for M2 Neural Engine?"
3. Ask: "Help me implement the fallback for non-Neural Engine devices"
```

### Procedural Content Workflow

```
1. Ask: "Create an MCP system for procedural tree generation"
2. Ask: "How should I structure my ONNX model for this system?"
3. Ask: "Show me how to integrate with terrain system"
```
