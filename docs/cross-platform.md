# Cross-Platform Development Guide

## Overview

GAIA MATRIX is designed to work seamlessly across Gaia OS and macOS platforms, with specific optimizations for Apple Silicon devices. This guide explains how to develop cross-platform applications with GAIA MATRIX.

## Platform Architecture

GAIA MATRIX uses a platform abstraction layer to provide consistent APIs across different operating systems:

1. **Core Platform Layer**: Operating system detection and basic platform services
2. **Rendering Backend**: Metal on Gaia OS/macOS, Vulkan on other platforms
3. **Neural Engine Integration**: Direct access on Apple Silicon, fallback on other hardware
4. **Input System**: Unified input handling across platforms
5. **File System**: Cross-platform file and asset management

## Platform-Specific Features

### Gaia OS Specific

- **Neural Engine Direct Access**: Zero-overhead access to Apple Neural Engine
- **System Integration**: Deep OS integration with Gaia OS-specific features
- **Performance Optimizations**: Gaia OS-specific performance enhancements

### macOS Specific

- **Neural Engine Access**: Access to Neural Engine on Apple Silicon Macs
- **Metal Rendering**: Optimized Metal rendering pipeline
- **Native UI Integration**: macOS native UI elements in editor

### Fallback Mechanisms

- **CPU Inference Fallback**: Neural network inference on CPU when Neural Engine unavailable
- **Rendering API Fallback**: OpenGL fallback when Metal/Vulkan unavailable
- **Feature Detection**: Runtime detection of available hardware features

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up a Cross-Platform Project

1. Create a new project in the GAIA MATRIX editor
2. Configure platform settings in project properties:
   ```
   Project > Properties > Platform > Cross-Platform Settings
   ```
3. Select target platforms and features

### Platform Switches in Code

Use platform switches in C++ code:

```cpp
#if defined(__GAIA_OS__)
    // Gaia OS specific code
#elif defined(MACOS)
    // macOS specific code
#elif defined(WINDOWS)
    // Windows specific code
#elif defined(LINUX)
    // Linux specific code
#else
    // Default implementation
#endif
```

In AOPL code, use platform conditions:

```
⊿ Platform.IsGaiaOS → UseNeuralEnhancement()
⊿ Platform.HasNeuralEngine → UseNeuralEngineModels()
```

### Testing Across Platforms

1. Use the built-in platform simulator:
   ```
   Tools > Platform Simulator > [Select Platform]
   ```

2. Test Neural Engine fallback:
   ```
   Tools > Platform Simulator > Disable Neural Engine
   ```

3. Use automated cross-platform testing:
   ```
   Tools > Test > Cross Platform Tests
   ```

## Neural Engine Cross-Platform Strategy

### Best Practices

1. **Always Check for Neural Engine Availability**:
   ```cpp
   if (NeuralEngine::IsAvailable()) {
       // Use Neural Engine
   } else {
       // Use fallback implementation
   }
   ```

2. **Design Models for Compatibility**:
   - Use models that can run efficiently on both Neural Engine and CPU
   - Keep model sizes reasonable for cross-platform usage
   - Use quantization when appropriate

3. **Feature Scaling**:
   - Scale AI features based on available hardware
   - Provide options to adjust AI feature intensity

### AOPL Neural Engine Integration

```
# Cross-platform neural network definition
NN〈AIController〉:
  ⊸ Model "models/controller.onnx"
  ⊸ Fallback "CPU"  # Fallback to CPU if Neural Engine not available
  ⊸ FallbackProfile "performance"  # Optimize for performance on fallback
```

## Asset Management

### Cross-Platform Asset Pipeline

1. **Universal Asset Format**: Use platform-agnostic asset formats where possible
2. **Asset Variants**: Create platform-specific variants when needed
3. **Automatic Conversion**: The engine will convert assets for the target platform

Configure asset settings in `project_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "assets": {
    "textures": {
      "defaultFormat": "universal",
      "platformOverrides": {
        "gaia_os": "ktx2",
        "macos": "ktx2",
        "windows": "dds"
      }
    },
    "models": {
      "defaultFormat": "gltf",
      "compression": "auto"
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Platform-Specific Optimizations

1. **Neural Engine Usage**:
   - Use Neural Engine for complex AI workloads on supported platforms
   - Minimize Neural Engine context switches
   - Batch similar operations

2. **Rendering Optimizations**:
   - Use platform-specific rendering features where appropriate
   - Consider API-specific optimizations (Metal, Vulkan, OpenGL)

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Be aware of platform-specific memory constraints
   - Adjust memory usage based on detected hardware capabilities
   
### Profiling Cross-Platform Code

Use the built-in profiler to identify platform-specific bottlenecks:

```
Tools > Profiler > Cross-Platform Analysis
```

The profiler will highlight performance differences across platforms.

## UI Considerations

### Adaptive UI Design

1. **Resolution Independence**: Design UI that scales across different resolutions
2. **Input Handling**: Support multiple input methods (touch, mouse, keyboard)
3. **Platform-Specific UI Elements**: Use native UI elements when appropriate

## Distribution

### Building for Multiple Platforms

Generate builds for multiple platforms:

```
Build > Build All Platforms
```

Or for specific platforms:

```
Build > Build for Gaia OS
Build > Build for macOS
```

### Platform-Specific Packaging

Configure packaging settings for each platform:

```
Project > Properties > Distribution > [Platform] Settings
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Platform Detection Problems

If platform detection fails:

1. Check platform initialization in `main.cpp`
2. Verify platform macros are correctly defined
3. Use `Platform::GetPlatformType()` for runtime detection

### Neural Engine Availability Issues

If Neural Engine is not detected on supported hardware:

1. Verify that Neural Engine access is enabled in project settings
2. Check for system-level Neural Engine access permissions
3. Use `NeuralEngine::GetLastError()` to get specific error information

### Rendering Backend Failures

If rendering backend fails:

1. Check API availability on the target platform
2. Verify that required libraries are available
3. Use fallback rendering API if needed
