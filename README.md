# GAIA MATRIX
## Game Artificial Intelligence Acceleration: Machine-learning Architecture for Technology, Rendering, Intelligence & cross-platform

Welcome to GAIA MATRIX, the next-generation game engine designed specifically for Gaia OS and macOS platforms. GAIA MATRIX leverages the power of Apple Silicon's Neural Engine through Gaia OS, providing game developers with unprecedented AI capabilities while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

## Overview

GAIA MATRIX combines high-performance rendering with AI-assisted development workflows and runtime intelligence. Using the AI-Optimized Programming Language (AOPL) as its primary scripting language, the engine achieves extreme token efficiency and optimal performance for AI workloads.

### Key Features

- **Neural Engine Integration**: Direct access to Apple Silicon Neural Engine via Gaia OS
- **AOPL Scripting Language**: Ultra-compact AI-optimized language for game development
- **AI Assistant**: In-editor AI conversation system for development assistance
- **Model-Controlled Procedural Generation**: AI-powered content generation
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Seamless operation on both Gaia OS and macOS
- **Modular Architecture**: Flexible component-based design
- **Real-time Neural Rendering**: AI-enhanced graphics pipeline

## Project Status

This project is currently in early development (version 0.1.0-Alpha). The current repository contains:

- Core engine architecture
- AOPL language parser skeleton
- Neural Engine integration framework
- Platform abstraction layer
- Renderer and Editor interfaces
- Documentation for API and features

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.16 or higher
- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- macOS 12.0+ or Gaia OS (for Neural Engine features)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gaia-matrix/gaia-matrix.git
cd gaia-matrix

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure
cmake ..

# Build
cmake --build .

# Run
./bin/gaia_matrix
```

For Gaia OS specific features:

```bash
cmake -DGAIA_OS=ON ..
```

## System Requirements

### Gaia OS
- Gaia OS version 1.0 or higher
- Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3 with Neural Engine access
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- 4GB free disk space (10GB recommended for full installation)

### macOS
- macOS 12.0 or higher
- Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3 or Intel processor with AVX2 support
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- 4GB free disk space (10GB recommended for full installation)

## Getting Started

1. Build the engine or install a pre-built version
2. Launch GAIA MATRIX from your applications menu or terminal
3. Create a new project using the editor
4. Explore the AOPL scripting language and Neural Engine features

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs` directory:

- [AOPL Language Reference](docs/aopl-reference.md)
- [Neural Engine Integration](docs/neural-engine.md)
- [AI Assistance Guide](docs/ai-assistance.md)

## AOPL Scripting Example

```
# Game Entity Definition in AOPL
N ⊢ E〈PlayerEntity〉〈T⊕C⊕I〉 # Entity with Transform, Controller, and Input components
T: P 0 1 0 → R 0 0 0 → S 1 1 1  # Position, Rotation, Scale
C: F Move Jump → ⊻ OnUpdate OnCollision  # Functions and event handlers
I: ⊢ K → M → G  # Keyboard, Mouse, Gamepad input

# Player Controller Component
N〈PlayerController〉: V ⊢ I → F Move → A Jump → C Collision
Move: I.K W → T.P z+ 0.1
Move: I.K S → T.P z- 0.1
Move: I.K A → T.P x- 0.1
Move: I.K D → T.P x+ 0.1
Jump: I.K Space → V.y 5 → ⊿ grounded
Collision: ⊿ ground → ⊸ grounded true → V.y 0

# Neural Network for Player Animation
NN〈PlayerAnimator〉: E PlayerEntity → O Animation
⊸ Model "models/player_animator.onnx"
⊸ Input V T.R I.K
⊸ Output "walk" "run" "jump" "idle"
```
